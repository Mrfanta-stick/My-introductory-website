                I am a self-taught programmer and I love to learn new things every day.
                <br>
                I also enjoy cooking and trying out new recipes in my free time.
                <br> 
                And when I'm not coding or cooking, you can find me playing games or writing poerty or making digital art 
                <br>
                I'm a very shy and introverted person, but I love to make new friends and connect with people who share my interests.
                <br>
                I might be dry at first but I open up once I get to know you better and trust me you'll see a side of me so different.
                <br>
                I'm also dark skinned so don't bother if you're a racist or have any issues with that.
