            By utter coincidence our paths did meet,
            I never knew one glance could make my soul complete.
            I thought to simply leave this passing scene and end,
            And now I ask, please say, will you be my dearest friend?

            As swiftly as the moments past us flew,
            Your smile, more bright than stars, as lovely as the dew.
            To find you was like water in a barren land,
            And now I ask, my love, will you just hold my hand?

            The seven seas do not compare to the depth of my true love,
            Your gentle spirit, kind and pure, I see within a dove.
            With eyes of life, my secrets I can no longer hold within my heart,
            For my life's great puzzle, I ask, will you now be a part?

            Through paths of fire, I'd keep you close to my heart,
            My soul is yours, though we may one day be apart.
            To lift your every burden is an offer I'd never decline,
            And thus I ask, my love, will you forever be entirely mine?

            <div class="poem-title">Something I wish to say</div>
            I'd never let my heart belong to anyone,
            until it became a home you settled in.
            It’s here with you, where all my doubts are gone,
            a life of quiet love I'd gladly live within.

            I will not search for some grand, fancy phrase,
            to tell you of the moments we have shared.
            But simply say I’ve treasured all our days,
            my soul by yours, so easily repaired.

            A friend, companion, a love I can’t deserve,
            you light my life like moonlight on the sea.
            My heart would stop, my every nerve would swerve,
            if I should wake and find you're not with me.

            I'd follow your voice without a lantern's light,
            upon a path so shrouded and so deep.
            And in that shadow of the endless night,
            I’d find a peace my soul was meant to keep.

            I'll be your haven, where you can blindly trust,
            though I'm not perfect, handsome, or a dream.
            In this cruel world of deceit and dust,
            I'll be the pause, the calm within the stream.

            To me, you are the only sweet life brings,
            the truest treasure my two eyes have seen.
            My heart can’t think of letting go of things,
            that make my world so perfect and serene.

            To stop time now, and spend a while with you,
            I'd give my soul, a moment to suspend.
            And if you would not, I'd ask forever to,
            convince you to be with me till the end.

            That perfect heart, a soul so very pure,
            if love had shape, that’s all that it would be.
            A memory I’d forevermore secure,
            a vision for the world to learn from thee.

            Your gentle smile, that morning voice so rough,
            the quiet whisper, and the laugh you share,
            I never get of these dear things enough,
            a melody beyond all other prayer.

            Your flaws, mistakes, the sadness you can't hide,
            are precious, for they prove your soul is true.
            So trust me now, I’m standing by your side,
            I have no problem in accepting all of you.

            Oh, Mellow Mockingbird, where did your song go?
            Don't be so lost; come back to us, you know,
            You want to sing again, a melody so bright,
            To break the weary silence of the night.

            My heart desires to sing its song again,
            But can those who plucked my feathers ever feel my pain?
            I'll keep my voice bound by my deep distrust,
            Even as my hopeful heart begins to rust.

            Oh, Mellow mockingbird, you can't keep it caged forever, don't you see?
            The spark of life within you yearns to be set free.
            You watch the others, filled with songs of joy and light,
            Longing to return from this lonely, endless night.

            Perhaps I do, this weary heart's desire is a mystery,
            Though torn and bruised, it longs for grace and sunlit glory.
            I chose this path, letting my songs fade and die,
            Until someone hears my heart, and not just what my wings supply.

            <div class="poem-title">The day we met</div>
            Roses are red,
            Violets are blue,
            The day I met you,
            I wasn't yet in love with you.

            But we became friends,
            Closer than ever before.
            The day I met you,
            Everything changed forevermore.

            Not all roses are red,
            Violets can never be truly blue.
            And though we may be separated by distance,
            It doesn't mean I'll stop caring for you.

            To have found you,
            Felt like living a dream.
            A quiet peace, not all alone,
            But vibrant beside a flowing stream.

            It didn't take long at all,
            The world got its colors from gray.
            The day I met you,
            I hoped that amazing person would be mine someday.
